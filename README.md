# Hawthorn
Shelves for all your organization needs! This mod adds my take on vanilla shelf layouts, as well as being a repository of shelves for certain mods (mostly legacies). I eventually aim to include shelves for most major mods on the workshop, although development has slowed significantly as I've mostly stopped playing Cultist Sim.


Currently available shelves (Note that these shelves will only appear in the options if you have these mods installed!)
