Shelves for all your organization needs! This mod adds my take on vanilla shelf layouts, as well as being a repository of shelves for certain mods (mostly legacies). I eventually aim to include shelves for most major mods on the workshop, although development has slowed significantly as I've mostly stopped playing Cultist Sim.


Currently available shelves (Note that these shelves will only appear in the options if you have these mods installed!)

possibly more


Note: all Shelves mods will now only work on the gateofhorn beta branch, due to The Roost Machine only supporting the beta branch.


Special thanks to [Xardis](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198187315102) for letting me use some assets, and advising me while I made others
